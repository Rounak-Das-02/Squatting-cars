      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <h3>
        This Car module can work by receiving multiple types of input as signal.
        In the Squat to Race project we have used machine learning frameworks to
        process your squatting gesture and used it to power the car. When it
        comes to live video processing and recognition using AI, there can be
        various gestures or methods to control the Car. Similarly, audio signals
        or voice can also be used to control the car.

      <h2>Future Scope</h2>
      <h3>
        One good usecase we look forward to, is using the module to improve tech
        and help physically challenged ones control machinery or vehicles using
        various gestures, voice inputs, etc.
